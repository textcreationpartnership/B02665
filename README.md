#A dainty dialogue between Henry and Elizabeth. Being the good wives vindication, and the bad husbands reformation. This new composed gallant ditty, is to be sung in town and city. This ballad is both compriz'd and penn'd to teach bad husbands how their lives to mend: all you good wives, the which bad husbands have, for your own good, let me this favour crave, one penny on this ditty to bestow, and carry it to your husbands for to show; it may in time make you twice over glad, when as you see him good that was so bad. The tune is, The tyrant.#
